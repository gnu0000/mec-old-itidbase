Suggestions for The New BAMS Database API (database primitives)


I am writing this document to suggest a design approach for the 
new BAMS database API to be created for the batch re-write.  I
feel I am qualified to make these suggestion simply because I
am the poor shmuck that designed and implemented the CES database
module/API.  For those of you who aren't familiar with CES, it is
a BAMS module that uses Microsoft SQL Server using call level API


















Having designed and coded the Database module for CES, I have learned 
several things 







Database API

        Use a layered approach & minimize exposure to external DB routines


        DbInit ........... Module init
        DbTerm ........... Module term
        DbLogin .......... User login
        DbLogout ......... User logout
        DbExecQuery ...... execs an SQL string - Query, update, etc...
        DbGetRow ......... if Exec was a query this gets the rows
        DbTermQuery ...... This terminates the open cursor
        DbResults ........ Query metatada - error status, etc ...
        DbGetColData ..... Query metatada - col sizes and types, ...


        DbGetCell ........ 
        DbExecToBuff .....
        DbNumRows ........


        Make it simple




        Use handles






C suggestions
        Use Name Prefix for API
        No Globals
        Hungarian notation
        User Types
        Standard ITI C conventions
